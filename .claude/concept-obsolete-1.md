## 1. Problem

Creating useful datasets requires collecting **records that all share the same fields** (e.g. title, author, rating).

In practice, this is difficult and tedious:

- each new record requires manual research for all fields  
- ensuring consistency across records is hard  
- keeping data up to date requires ongoing effort  

As a result:
- datasets are often incomplete  
- inconsistent  
- or outdated  

**Datapods solves this problem** by providing a system that enables users to:

> **define structured datasets where all records conform to the same fields, and be actively supported in creating and maintaining them**

---

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 Completion
- Automatically researches and extracts missing field values  
- Uses **user-defined data sources and instructions**  
- Ensures all records are **complete and consistent with the defined schema**  

---

### 2.2 Updates
- Re-extracts values for **volatile fields**  
- Keeps datasets up to date over time  
- Runs continuously or on demand  

---

### 2.3 Discovery
- Automatically discovers new records that match user-defined criteria  
- Based on **natural language instructions** (e.g. “find all X”)  
- For each discovered record, **extracts all defined fields according to the dataset schema**  

---

## 3. Data Definition & Extraction

Users define:

- the **schema** (fields of the dataset)  
- the **data sources** to use  
- **extraction instructions** for each field  

This allows the system to:

- automatically obtain data  
- fill missing values  
- maintain consistency across all records  

A key aspect is that:

> **the user explicitly defines how data is obtained and structured**

Discovery works via:

- natural-language instructions  
- arbitrary levels of specificity  

---

## 4. Interface

All datasets are:

- exposed via an **API as JSON**  
- accessible to any client application  

This allows the data to be:

- displayed in any format  
- used in any application  
- integrated into existing systems  

---

## 5. Automation and Manual Control

Datapods combines automation with user control:

- data can always be **edited manually**  
- users can add or override values  
- users decide:
  - what is automated  
  - what is manual  

This enables:

> **curation where necessary, automation where possible**

---

## 6. Data Evolution

Datasets are not static and can evolve over time:

- users can edit the schema  
- reshape datasets  
- update extraction instructions  

The system adapts and:

- re-extracts data  
- updates existing records  

This provides flexibility to:

> **continuously refine and improve structured datasets**

---

## 7. Backups & Version Control (Optional)

Datasets can optionally be:

- backed by Git repositories  

This enables:

- full version control  
- history tracking  
- recovery of previous states  

It provides:

> **confidence that no data is ever lost and encourages experimentation**
